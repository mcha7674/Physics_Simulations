# ProjectileMotionSim
A Projectile Motion Simulation with PyQt implemented GUI, matplotlib, pandas, and data generated through c++.
This project is intended to showcase projectile motion physics with a variety of factors such as drag and altitude density changes. It also serves as a way to generate and save projectile data to perform your own analysis on.

To run simply clone the repo or download the zip file and open the executable "Projectile_Sim.exe".
